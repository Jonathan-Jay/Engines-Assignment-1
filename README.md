46 word description:  
This a 2.5D platformer with level editing capabilities, that has a player that can throw bombs and walljump, as well as enemies, all controlled by DLLs for UI and stats. The editor provides the base tools required to create levels with enemy spawners, healthpacks and crates.

To mod the game, grab the dll wanted from the DLLs folder and paste it into the plugins folder of Unity, then rename it ModDLL.dll or UIDLL.dll

We had a whopping 5 Design patterns implemented:  
Singleton in the event and command managers  
Observer using C# events  
Command using the FunctionData interface as base  
Factory using the Spawnable interface as base  
Object Pooling in the bomb system (player class)


Old description:

This game is a 2.5D platforming game. The player can move, jump, attack, and wall jump in order to fight enemies and reach the goal block at the end of the stage. In the level editor, the user gains control of anything that has a hitbox, aka everything. they can move them, scale them and even delete them (no deleting the player though). The editor tracks these changes and allows for undoing and redoing them. they can access this by just pausing the game (pressing P), this will pause physics, so do be wary of the players velocity when pausing.
